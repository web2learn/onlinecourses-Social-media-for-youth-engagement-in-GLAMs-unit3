<p>The examples presented in Unit 3 are the result of  an activity of the EU funded project The GLAMers. This activity served to identify ways of digitally mediated youth engagement among European GLAMs  during the pandemic. The output consisted of the collection and processing of 92 practices adopted by GLAMs throughout the pandemic period and concluded with the acknowledgment of the 15 most original initiatives. Part of the examples outlined in Unit 3 is derived from the <a href="https://glamers.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-GLAMers-Study.pdf">Zourou K. & Pellegrini E. study</a> released in 2021. </p>

                        <p class="display-7">See below two of the most creative practices that made exclusive use of Instagram to promote their projects motivating young people to get involved.</p>
                        <h5><b>3.1.1. Instagram - Giacometti Foundation, Paris, France</b></h5>
                        <p>The Foundation supported its audience to discover the work of Alberto Giacometti even in times of pandemics and mobility restrictions through digital engagement methods and tools. The <a href="https://www.fondation-giacometti.fr/en/event/114/giacomettichezvous">Giacometti Foundation</a> launched <b>educational workshops</b> on social networks where young visitors were invited to participate.</p>

                        <p>It was a series of 10 tutorials of creative activities, talking about art history and showing how to create artistic objects the way Giacometti did. Participants were then called to post their final creation resulting from the workshop on <b>Instagram</b>, mentioning the institution’s account @fondation_giacometti for recognition and reposting. </p>

<p>In this context, the Foundation also launched the hashtag <b>#GiacomettiChezVous</b> across all social media, maximizing thus the impact of its action.</p>
                        <h5><b>3.1.2. Instagram - Photography Museum (FOAM), Amsterdam, The Netherlands</b></h5>
                        <p>Below is the second of the most creative practices that made exclusive use of <b>Instagram</b> to promote their projects motivating young people to get involved: <b> Instagram - Photography Museum (FOAM), Amsterdam, The Netherlands</b></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.foam.org/museum/remake">Museum’s initiative</a> challenged its audience to reinterpret, in their own way, artworks of Dutch photographers from the museum’s collection or exhibitions.</p>

                        <h2>3.2. Cultural initiatives organised through Youtube</h2>
                        <p class="display-7">YouTube is undoubtedly one of the most popular social media platforms and so, numerous digital actions organised by GLAMs took place by creating videos and uploading them on Youtube. Let’s see now two of these kinds of actions undertaken.</p><h5>3.2.1. YouTube - By Anne Frank House, Amsterdam, The Netherlands<b></b></h5>
                        <p>Anne Frank House has developed the Anne Frank video diary initiative through the release of 15 YouTube episodes based on Anne Frank's diary letters.</p>
                        <center><img class="responsive" src="assets/3_04-%20Anne%20Frank%20House.png"></center><p><i><small><center>Anne Frank video diary project, Image via <a href="https://www.annefrank.org/en/museum/web-and-digital/video-diary/">https://www.annefrank.org/en/museum/web-and-digital/video-diary/</a></center></small></i></p>
                        <p>The Institution also created additional educational episodes explaining and elaborating on what can be seen in the video diaries. One of the activities proposed the creation of workbooks linked to the Anne Frank video diary and the extra educational episodes. The museum’s aim is to talk to young people about Anne Frank's life story and make them think of the theories that are developed in relation to her story.</p>

                        <h5><b>3.2.2. YouTube - By Museum of Literature Ireland (MoLI), Dublin, Ireland</b></h5>
                        <p>Museum of  Literature, Ireland, launched in collaboration with Sarah Webb, an award-winning children’s writer and children’s book champion,the <a href="https://moli.ie/learning/bright-sparks-creative-bursts/">Bright Sparks Creative Bursts</a> initiative.</p>

                        <p>Children, but also adults, were called to follow Sarah’s video series talking about word games, fantastic stories and metaphors, and get inspired to keep their own diary or journal with their personal stories. Furthermore, one of the project goals was to enhance <b>intergenerational creativity</b> and connectivity!</p>

                        <p class="display-7">According to our research, many GLAMs started to use multiple social media channels during the pandemic aiming to engage a wider audience, especially the youngest part of it.</p>
                        <h5><b>3.3.1. Youtube & hashtags for social networks - Singer Laren, Laren, The Netherlands</b></h5>

<p><a href="https://www.singerlaren.nl/en/pQJ3rHB/singer-tv-kids">Singer Laren Museum </a>developed activities for children to be involved with its collections while at home. The museum developed workshops where children got tips on how to recreate artworks and sculptures themselves.</p> 
                         <center><img class="responsive" src="assets/3_06-Singer%20Laren.png"></center><p><i><small><center>Singer Laren, Netherlands, Singer TV Kids,<a href="https://www.singerlaren.nl/en/pQJ3rHB/singer-tv-kids">Image via https://www.singerlaren.nl/en/pQJ3rHB/singer-tv-kids</a></center></small></i></p>
<p>Through questions and activities, children <b>learned</b> about diverse artists' backgrounds, observed their paintings and <b>examined</b> small details. Then, they were called to produce their own artwork and share it on social networks using the hashtags <b>#singerlaren</b> and <b>#singeratelierbijjethuis</b>.</p>
                        <h5><b>3.3.2. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter - Northern Ireland War Memorial Museum, (NIWM) Belfast, UK</b></h5>
                        <p>On the occasion of #NationalDrawingDay, NIWM invited children to join the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?embed=no&v=ls3nPespFJg">Museum on YouTube</a>, where Catherine and Michael, the museum’s Learning Facilitator and Outreach Officer, showed participants different ways to <b>create their own commemorative craft</b> based on artwork inspired by the Northern Ireland War Memorial gallery. </p>

                        <p>This <b>art and craft activity</b> was created in partnership with the artist and ceramicist Diane McCormick. Also, the <b>YouTube</b> video guided participants on how to create their own commemorative artwork. Afterwards, participants were invited to send their work directly to the museum by post or email. Alternatively, they could share it with the museum on <b>Facebook</b>, <b>Instagram</b> and <b>Twitter</b>. <p>The Museum also launched its own <b>hashtag</b> campaign <b>#NationalDrawingDay on social media.</b></p>
                        <h5><b>3.3.3. Hashtags on all social media - National Museums Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom</b></h5>
                        <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/my-home-my-museum">National Museums Liverpool</a> (NML) asked children who were off school to create their own exhibition or gallery of artworks inspired by their own lives, such as their favourite toys, clothes, souvenirs or drawings.</p>
                        <center><img class="responsive" src="assets/3_08-National%20Museums%20Liverpool.png"></center><p><i><small><center>National Museums Liverpool, UK, My Home is My Museum, Image via <a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/my-home-my-museum">https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/my-home-my-museum</a></center></small></i></p>
                        <p>In particular, the children had to think of 10 things and/or people that are important to them and then write a short explanation of each of their options. Subsequently, they were asked to give a name to their exhibition, design a poster and create a promotional video that was shared on social media using the hashtag <b>#MyHomeIsMyMuseum</b>. The winners also took part in a digital exhibition and met a curator who shared tips on setting up an exceptional exhibition.</p>

    <h5><b>3.3.4. TikTok, Instagram, Facebook & QR code - The Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art (S.M.A.K.), Ghent, Belgium</b></h5>
                        <p>A very interesting project was organised during the pandemic by The Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgium that used multiple digital social networks to carry out its project.</p>

                        <p>The S.M.A.K. organised an imaginary museum and a 90-minutes open air activity for kids. The audience was invited to discover Citadel Park in Ghent, Belgium, and to dive into the <a href="https://smak.be/en/news/can-you-hear-what-i-hear-imaginary-museum-in-the-citadelpark">Imaginary Museum</a> activity, where children, closing their eyes, could listen as works of art came to life.</p>

                        <p>This action was also based on the use of the museum’s <b>Heritage app</b> that participants were called to download and then <b>the QR code</b> to open the map of the Park and see the route and the place where the imaginary artworks were located in the Park. Additionally, the museum invited the young public to <b>take a selfie</b>, a funny image and <b>share</b> it via TikTok, Instagram or Facebook using the hashtags <b>#schattenvanvlieg #smakgent</b>.</p>
